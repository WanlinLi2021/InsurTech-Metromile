# Overview and Origin

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2011, Metromile was founded in California by David Friedberg and Steve Pretre, 
to provide a new kind of car insurance that would be fairer, more affordable, and more flexible than traditional policies. 
Metromile offers pricing primarily based on mileage, with lower rates for those who drive infrequently. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea for Metromile came about when Friedberg and Pretre realized that many people in cities 
like San Francisco were driving less and relying more on alternative transportation options like biking, walking, and public transit. 
They recognized that traditional car insurance policies charged a flat rate, regardless of how much people actually drove, 
which meant that people who drove less were effectively subsidizing those who drove more. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address this issue, Friedberg and Pretre came up with the idea of offering car insurance 
that was priced based on how much people actually drove. They believed this would be a more fair and more affordable option for people who didn't use 
their cars as much while still providing the same level of coverage as traditional insurance policies. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 2016, they announced a new round of $192 million in funding and acquired a carrier, 
enabling them to start underwriting their policies. The company became publicly listed in February 2021 in a reverse merger deal, supported by Betsy Z. Cohen, who also joined the company’s board of directors. 
On 28 July 2022, Lemonade, Inc. fully acquired Metromile in an all-stock transaction with a fully diluted equity value of approximately $500 million, or around $200 million net of cash. Following the acquisition, 
Lemonade laid off 20% of Metromile's staff. </p>

# Business Activities 

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditional auto insurance is unfair to drivers who drive infrequently. Metromile exclusively sells pay-per-mile car 
insurance policies. The company estimates that people who drive fewer than 10,000 miles per year can save hundreds of 
dollars annually. In addition to offering car insurance, the company also provides various tools and services to help drivers
better understand their car usage and manage their expenses. </p>

## Intended Customers

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metromile’s intended customers are those who don’t drive much and don’t mind having 
their driving tracked. Their pay-per-mile policies are best for drivers who have low monthly mileage, work from home, or 
have another vehicle that is rarely in use. 
However, for people who drive longer distances regularly, Metromile perhaps is not a good option. </p>

## Market Size

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of February 2023, Metromile has a market capitalization of $0.13 billion. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Metromile's latest financial reports, the company's current revenue is $0.10 billion. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Metromile's latest financial reports the company's current earnings are -$0.22 billion. </p>
